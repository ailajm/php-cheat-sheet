Conditional Statments

# Conditional Statments

* The `if...elseif...else` statement executes different codes for more than two conditions.

## Switch Statment

* The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

	* Use the switch statement to select one of many blocks of code to be executed.

* Syntax

```
switch (n) {
  case label1:
    code to be executed if n=label1;
    break;
  case label2:
    code to be executed if n=label2;
    break;
  case label3:
    code to be executed if n=label3;
    break;
    ...
  default:
    code to be executed if n is different from all labels;
}
```

* This is how it works: 
	
	* First we have a single expression n (most often a variable), that is evaluated once. The value of the expression is then compared with the values for each case in the structure. If there is a match, the block of code associated with that case is executed. 

	* Use break to prevent the code from running into the next case automatically. The default statement is used if no match is found.
